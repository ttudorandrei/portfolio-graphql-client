## Description

Hi! My name is Tudor Andrei Tocan and this is my portfolio. It was built using GraphQL server side (because why not :sweat_smile:) and ReactJS client-side.

## User story

```
WHEN I want to know more about Tudor's background as a software developer I visit his online portfolio;

WHEN I first load the portfolio, I am presented with the "About Me" section containing a photo and a short description;

WHEN I click on the "Contact Me" button in the navbar, I am presented with a page displaying a list of social media links, a "contact me" form and a button to send an email;

WHEN I load the "Portfolio" page, I am presented with a list of projects. Each project has a photo, a short description, links to gihub repo and to deployed application.

WHEN I load the "Resume" page I am presented with a list of Skills as well as a button to download the developers Resume.
